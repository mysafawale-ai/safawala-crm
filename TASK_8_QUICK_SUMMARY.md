# ✅ Task 8 Complete - Calendar Enhanced!

## 🎯 What Was Done

Enhanced the booking calendar with **smart status-based color coding** and moved it to the **top of dashboard** for maximum visibility!

---

## 🎨 New Color System

### Before (Count-Based)
```
🟢 Green  → 0 bookings
🔵 Blue   → 1-20 bookings
🔴 Red    → 20+ bookings
```

### After (Status-Based) ✨
```
🟢 Green   → Confirmed bookings
🔵 Blue    → Delivered bookings
🟠 Orange  → Pending payment
🟣 Purple  → Quotes
⚫ Gray    → Cancelled
⚪ White   → No bookings
```

---

## 📅 Calendar Priority System

When a day has multiple booking statuses, shows **highest priority**:

```
Priority Order:
1️⃣ Confirmed     (Green)  ← Most important!
2️⃣ Delivered     (Blue)
3️⃣ Pending       (Orange) ← Needs attention
4️⃣ Quote         (Purple) ← Sales opportunity
5️⃣ Cancelled     (Gray)
```

**Example Day**:
- Has: 2 quotes + 1 confirmed + 1 pending
- Shows: **🟢 Green** (confirmed wins!)

---

## 🎯 Enhanced Dialog

**Before**:
```
Event Details - Oct 25, 2025
[12 bookings]
```

**After**:
```
Event Details - Oct 25, 2025
[12 total] [8 confirmed] [3 delivered] [1 pending]
        ✨ Status breakdown badges! ✨
```
