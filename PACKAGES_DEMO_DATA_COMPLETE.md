## 🔧 Technical Details

### SQL Script Location:
```
/Applications/safawala-crm/scripts/packages/add-demo-packages-mysafawale.sql
```

### Tables Modified:
- `packages_categories` - 1 category (Wedding Packages)
- `package_sets` - 9 new packages
- `package_variants` - 81 new variants
- `distance_pricing` - 405 new pricing records

### Franchise Isolation:
✅ All packages created with correct `franchise_id` from mysafawale@gmail.com user
✅ Frontend filtering implemented in `/app/sets/page.tsx` (lines 48-60)
✅ Non-super-admins only see their franchise packages
✅ Super admin sees all packages across all franchises

## 🎯 Example Pricing Calculation

**Example:** 21 Safa Package - Gold - Complete Wedding Set

- Base Package Price: ₹6,000
- Gold Tier Multiplier: 1.5x = ₹9,000
- Variant Addition: +₹1,500 (variant 3)
- **Variant Base Price:** ₹10,500

**Distance Pricing:**
- 0-10 km: ₹10,500 + ₹0 = **₹10,500**
- 11-50 km: ₹10,500 + ₹1,000 = **₹11,500**
- 51-100 km: ₹10,500 + ₹2,000 = **₹12,500**
- 101-200 km: ₹10,500 + ₹3,500 = **₹14,000**
- 201+ km: ₹10,500 + ₹5,000 = **₹15,500**

## ✅ Verification Queries Included

The SQL script includes 5 verification queries to confirm creation:
1. Count packages created
2. List all packages with variant counts
3. Show sample variants for first package
4. Show sample distance pricing
5. Total counts across all layers

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Fixed

During creation, several schema mismatches were discovered and fixed:

1. ❌ `package_type` column doesn't exist → ✅ Removed
2. ❌ `price` column → ✅ Changed to `base_price_addition`
3. ❌ Missing `distance_range` column → ✅ Added
4. ❌ `from_pincode`, `to_pincode` columns → ✅ Removed (don't exist)
5. ❌ `max_km` NULL constraint → ✅ Changed to 999999
6. ❌ Verification query using wrong columns → ✅ Fixed

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Packages isolation implemented
2. ✅ Demo data created
3. 🔜 Test packages page at localhost:3000/sets
4. 🔜 Verify franchise filtering works
5. 🔜 Test super admin view
6. 🔜 Test package variant details
7. 🔜 Test distance pricing display

## 📝 Notes

- All demo packages use the same category: "Wedding Packages"
- Distance calculations based from pincode 390007
- Franchise isolation pattern matches customers and staff implementation
- RLS disabled on package tables (service role bypasses anyway)
- Frontend filtering provides the actual isolation mechanism
