# üîÑ Return Processing System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The return processing system allows you to handle returned rental items efficiently, automatically updating inventory and sending items to appropriate destinations (available stock, product archive, or laundry).

---

## üìä How It Works

### When Items Are Returned, They Can Go To:

1. **üü¢ Available Stock** (qty_not_used)
   - Items that were delivered but never used
   - Go directly back to available inventory
   - Skip laundry process

2. **üîµ Laundry** (qty_returned + send_to_laundry = true)
   - Items that were used and need cleaning
   - Automatically creates a laundry batch
   - Updates stock_in_laundry count
   - After laundry, moved to available

3. **üü† Product Archive - Damaged** (qty_damaged)
   - Items with damage
   - Moved to product_archive table
   - Reason: "damaged"
   - Requires damage details
   - Updates stock_damaged count

4. **üî¥ Product Archive - Lost/Stolen** (qty_lost)
   - Missing items
   - Moved to product_archive table
   - Reason: "lost" or "stolen"
   - Reduces total stock count
   - Requires lost/stolen details

## üîß Technical Flow

### 1. Frontend Form Submission
```typescript
// User fills form and clicks "Process Return"
const payload = {
  items: [
    {
      product_id: "...",
      qty_delivered: 10,
      qty_returned: 7,  // Used
      qty_not_used: 2,  // Extra
      qty_damaged: 1,   // Damaged
      qty_lost: 0,      // None lost
      damage_reason: "torn",
      damage_severity: "moderate",
      damage_description: "...",
    }
  ],
  send_to_laundry: true,
  notes: "...",
  processing_notes: "..."
}
```

### 2. API Processing (`/api/returns/[id]/process`)

```
Step 1: Validate quantities
  ‚îî‚îÄ Ensure qty_returned + qty_not_used + qty_damaged + qty_lost = qty_delivered

Step 2: Insert return_items records
  ‚îî‚îÄ Track what happened to each item

Step 3: Update product inventory
  ‚îú‚îÄ stock_available += qty_not_used + (send_to_laundry ? 0 : qty_returned)
  ‚îú‚îÄ stock_in_laundry += (send_to_laundry ? qty_returned : 0)
  ‚îú‚îÄ stock_damaged += qty_damaged
  ‚îú‚îÄ stock_total -= qty_lost
  ‚îî‚îÄ stock_booked -= qty_delivered

Step 4: Archive damaged items
  ‚îî‚îÄ INSERT INTO product_archive (reason='damaged', ...)

Step 5: Archive lost items
  ‚îî‚îÄ INSERT INTO product_archive (reason='lost', ...)

Step 6: Create laundry batch (if send_to_laundry)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Generate batch number: "LB-RET-{timestamp}"
  ‚îú‚îÄ INSERT INTO laundry_batches (auto_created=true)
  ‚îî‚îÄ INSERT INTO laundry_batch_items

Step 7: Update return record
  ‚îî‚îÄ status = 'completed', processed_at = NOW()
```

### 3. Backend Database Updates

```sql
-- Product inventory update
UPDATE products SET
  stock_available = stock_available + 2,  -- qty_not_used
  stock_in_laundry = stock_in_laundry + 7, -- qty_returned
  stock_damaged = stock_damaged + 1,      -- qty_damaged
  stock_total = stock_total - 0,          -- qty_lost
  stock_booked = stock_booked - 10        -- qty_delivered
WHERE id = :product_id;

-- Archive damaged
INSERT INTO product_archive (
  product_id, reason, quantity,
  damage_reason, severity, notes, ...
) VALUES (...);

-- Create laundry batch
INSERT INTO laundry_batches (
  batch_number, return_id, auto_created,
  status, total_items, notes
) VALUES ('LB-RET-123456', :return_id, true, 'pending', 7, ...);
