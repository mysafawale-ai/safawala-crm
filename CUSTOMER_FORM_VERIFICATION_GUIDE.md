## üéØ Success Criteria

**The customer form data persistence is considered VERIFIED when:**

1. **100% of valid submissions** save correctly to database
2. **100% of invalid submissions** are rejected with appropriate errors
3. **All CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work flawlessly
4. **Data integrity** is maintained across all operations
5. **Security measures** effectively prevent malicious inputs
6. **Audit logs** capture complete operational history
7. **Performance** meets acceptable response time standards
8. **UI consistency** reflects backend data accurately

**If any verification step fails, the issue should be resolved before considering the system production-ready.**
