## 🚀 Ready to Test!

**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/book-package`

The file is being finalized now. Once the server restarts, you'll see:

1. **Step 1** - Select category pills at top, packages below with "Show/Hide" button to reveal variant selection
2. **Step 2** - Customer search + all event details in one page
3. **Step 3** - Final review before creating quote or order

The variant selection is now **prominently displayed** in each package card when you click "Show"!

---

## 🎨 Variant Selection Design:

```
[Package Name Card]
  ├─ Show/Hide Button
  └─ When "Show" clicked:
      ├─ Variant Dropdown ⭐ (CLEAR & VISIBLE)
      ├─ Extra Safas Input
      ├─ Total Price Display
      └─ "Add to Order" Button
```

Much cleaner than before! No separate steps for category/package/variant - all in Step 1! 🎉
