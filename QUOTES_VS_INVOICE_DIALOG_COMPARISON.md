### Phase 2: Complete Customer & Event Info
Add missing fields from invoice data:
- Customer: WhatsApp, address, city, state, pincode

## 💡 Quick Fix Template

To match Quotes exactly, the Invoice dialog needs:

```tsx
// Add these fields to Invoice dialog:

// 1. Customer Info - COMPLETE
customer_whatsapp
customer_address
customer_city
customer_state
customer_pincode

// 2. Event Info - COMPLETE
event_participant OR participant
event_time
groom_whatsapp
groom_address
bride_whatsapp
bride_address
venue_name

// 3. Timeline - COMPLETE
delivery_time
return_time
special_instructions

// 4. Items Section - ADD ENTIRE SECTION
invoice_items[] {
  category
  product_name OR package_name
  package_description
  variant_name
  extra_safas
  variant_inclusions[]
  quantity
  unit_price
  total_price
}

// 5. Financial - COMPLETE
distance_amount
distance_km
discount_percentage (calculate or store)
coupon_code
coupon_discount
gst_percentage (dynamic, not hardcoded)
```

---

**Bottom Line:** Invoice dialog is ~60% complete compared to Quotes. The biggest gap is the **missing items section** - customers can't see what they're being charged for!
