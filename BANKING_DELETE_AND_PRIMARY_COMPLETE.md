## ✅ Primary Account Auto-Switch
**Status:** Fully implemented in backend and frontend!

### Backend Logic:
**POST (Create New Account):**
```sql
-- If is_primary is true, unset ALL other primary accounts
UPDATE banking_details 
SET is_primary = false 
WHERE franchise_id = ? 
```

**PUT (Update Account):**
```sql
-- If is_primary is true, unset ALL other primary accounts EXCEPT this one
UPDATE banking_details 
SET is_primary = false 
WHERE franchise_id = ? 
AND id != ?
```

### Frontend Features:
- 🔄 Switch toggle for "Set as primary account"
- 📝 Description: "This will be the default account for transactions"
- ⚠️ **NEW:** Warning message when primary is enabled:
  - "⚠ Other primary accounts will be automatically unmarked"
  - Shows in amber color
  - Only appears when switch is ON

### How It Works:
1. **User enables "Set as primary"** on any account
2. **Warning appears** immediately below the toggle
3. **On save**, API automatically:
   - Sets this account as `is_primary = true`
   - Sets ALL other accounts as `is_primary = false`
4. **UI refreshes** showing updated badges
5. **Only ONE account** will have "Primary" badge at a time

### Database Guarantees:
- ✅ Only ONE primary account per franchise_id
- ✅ Atomic operation (no race conditions)
- ✅ Works for both new accounts and updates
- ✅ Automatically maintains data integrity
