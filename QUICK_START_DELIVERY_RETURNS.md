# 🚀 QUICK START - Delivery & Returns System

## ⚡ Execute This Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy entire content from: `MIGRATION_DELIVERY_RETURN_SYSTEM.sql`
3. Paste and click **Run**
4. Wait for: ✅ All tables created successfully!

### Step 2: Test Auto-Creation (3 minutes)

**Test A: Create a Rental Booking**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
INSERT INTO product_orders (
  order_number, customer_id, franchise_id, 
  order_type, event_date, delivery_date, 
  delivery_address, created_by
) VALUES (
  'ORD-TEST-001',
  (SELECT id FROM customers LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM franchises LIMIT 1),
  'rental', -- Important: rental type
  CURRENT_DATE + 3,
  CURRENT_DATE + 2,
  '123 Test Street',
  (SELECT id FROM users LIMIT 1)
);

-- Verify delivery was auto-created:
SELECT * FROM deliveries 
WHERE booking_source = 'product_order' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Test B: Mark Delivery as Delivered**
```sql
-- Get the delivery ID from above, then:
UPDATE deliveries 
SET status = 'delivered'
WHERE id = 'YOUR_DELIVERY_ID';

-- Verify return was auto-created:
SELECT * FROM returns ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Use the Return Processing Dialog

1. Open your app: `http://localhost:3000/deliveries`
2. Go to **Returns** tab
3. Click **Process Return** on a pending return
4. In the dialog:
   - Enter quantities (returned/damaged/lost)
   - Select reasons for damaged/lost items
   - Check "Send to Laundry" if needed
   - Click **Preview Impact** to see inventory changes
   - Click **Process Return**

## 🎯 Key Points

### For Rentals (order_type='rental' or package_bookings):
1. Booking created → Delivery created (pending)
2. Delivery marked delivered → Return created (pending)
3. Return processed → Inventory updated, items archived

### For Sales (order_type='sale'):
1. Booking created → Delivery created (pending)
2. Delivery marked delivered → **NO return created** ✓
3. Process complete

### Quantity Rules:
- **Must balance**: `delivered = returned + damaged + lost`
- **Damaged**: Requires reason (torn, stained, etc.)
- **Lost**: Requires reason (stolen, lost, etc.)

### Inventory Impact:
- **Returned** → `stock_available++` (or laundry)
- **Damaged** → `stock_damaged++` + archived
- **Lost** → `stock_total--` + archived

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Troubleshooting:

**Migration failed?**
- Check if tables already exist (might need to drop first)
- Verify you're in the correct Supabase project
- Check for error messages in SQL output

**Delivery not auto-created?**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists:
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE 'auto_create_delivery%';
```

**Return not auto-created?**
```sql
-- Check delivery booking_type:
SELECT id, booking_type, status, return_created FROM deliveries ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**API errors?**
- Check browser console for details
- Verify Supabase connection
- Check table permissions
- Ensure tables exist
