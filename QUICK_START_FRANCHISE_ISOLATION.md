# üöÄ QUICK START - Franchise Isolation Implementation

## ‚ö° 3-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Super Admin HQ Franchise (2 minutes)
**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```
Copy from: scripts/CREATE_SUPER_ADMIN_HQ_FRANCHISE.sql
Click RUN
```
‚úÖ Creates HQ franchise (HQ001)
‚úÖ Assigns super admin to HQ
‚úÖ Sets up company settings

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Middleware in APIs (Per route)
**Use the middleware layer:**

```typescript
import { 
  getFranchiseContext,
  applyFranchiseFilter,
  getFranchiseIdForCreate,
  canAccessFranchise 
} from "@/lib/middleware/franchise-isolation"

// In your API route:
export async function GET() {
  const context = await getFranchiseContext()
  
  let query = supabase.from("customers").select("*")
  query = applyFranchiseFilter(query, context)
  // Super Admin: No filter (sees all)
  // Franchise Admin: Filtered by their franchise_id
  
  const { data } = await query
  return NextResponse.json({ data })
}
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Both User Types

**Test Super Admin:**
```sql
-- Should see HQ franchise
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Should see ALL customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
```

**Test Franchise Admin:**
```sql
-- Should see their franchise only
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
```
