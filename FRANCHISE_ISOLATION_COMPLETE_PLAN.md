# 🎯 COMPLETE FRANCHISE ISOLATION STRATEGY

## 📊 Current Problem
Right now, data is mixed up across franchises:
- ❌ All customers from all franchises showing together
- ❌ Bookings from different franchises mixed
- ❌ Settings not franchise-specific
- ❌ Reports showing combined data
- ❌ No way to filter by franchise
- ❌ Super admin can't distinguish between franchise data

---

## ✅ Complete Solution - Step by Step

### **PHASE 1: Database Foundation** ⚙️
Ensure every table has proper franchise_id and RLS policies

**What we'll do:**
1. ✅ Verify franchise_id exists in ALL tables
2. ✅ Add missing franchise_id columns where needed
3. ✅ Create/update RLS policies (DONE ✅)
4. ✅ Add indexes on franchise_id for performance
5. ✅ Ensure referential integrity

**Tables to check:**
- [x] customers
- [x] products
- [x] bookings
- [x] booking_items
- [x] invoices
- [x] expenses
- [x] expense_categories
- [x] staff
- [x] attendance
- [x] payroll
- [x] services
- [x] packages
- [x] deliveries
- [x] distance_pricing
- [x] company_settings
- [x] branding_settings
- [x] banking_details
- [x] user_profiles

### **PHASE 2: Backend API Layer** 🔧
Apply franchise filtering to ALL API routes

**What we'll do:**
1. Create middleware helper functions ✅ (Already done)
2. Update ALL existing API routes (20+ routes)
3. Add franchise validation to create/update/delete operations
4. Add proper error messages for access denied
