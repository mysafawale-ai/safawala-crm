const [batchNote, setBatchNote] = useState("")
const [addingNote, setAddingNote] = useState(false)
```

### Key Functions

#### Date Filtering
```typescript
// Integrated into filteredBatches logic
let matchesDate = true
if (dateFilter?.from || dateFilter?.to) {
  const batchDate = new Date(batch.sent_date)
  if (dateFilter.from) matchesDate = matchesDate && batchDate >= new Date(dateFilter.from)
  if (dateFilter.to) matchesDate = matchesDate && batchDate <= new Date(dateFilter.to)
}
```

#### Batch Editing
```typescript
const handleEditBatch = async (batch: LaundryBatch) => {
  // Loads batch and items for editing
}

const addEditItemToBatch = () => {
  // Adds new items to editing batch
}

const handleSaveBatchEdit = async () => {
  // Saves all changes with transaction
}
```

#### Notes Management
```typescript
const handleAddNote = async () => {
  // Appends timestamped note to batch
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Create Batch
1. Select vendor → Show vendor details
2. Add items → Calculate costs
3. Submit → Create batch and items
4. Refresh → Update table

### Edit Batch
1. Click edit → Load batch and items
2. Modify items → Recalculate totals
3. Save → Delete old items, insert new
4. Refresh → Update display

### Add Note
1. Enter note → Validate
2. Append timestamp → Save to database
3. Update local state → Show success
4. Refresh → Display updated notes

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

1. **Filtered Data**: Uses useMemo for pagination
2. **Lazy Loading**: Batch items loaded on-demand
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Local state updates before API
4. **Debouncing**: Search input could benefit from debouncing (future)
