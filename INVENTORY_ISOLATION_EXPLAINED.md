# üîí Franchise Isolation Strategy - Products

## Current Status: ‚úÖ WORKING (Frontend-based isolation)

Your inventory system **already has franchise isolation** built into the frontend code!

### How It Works:

```typescript
// In /app/inventory/page.tsx (line 120-122)
if (user.role !== "super_admin" && user.franchise_id) {
  query = query.eq("franchise_id", user.franchise_id)
}
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ **Franchise users** see ONLY their franchise's products
- ‚úÖ **Super admins** see ALL products from all franchises
- ‚úÖ Works without RLS policies

---

## Why RLS Won't Help Here

Your app uses **SERVICE ROLE KEY** in the frontend Supabase client, which:
- **Bypasses ALL RLS policies** (by design)
- Allows direct database access
- Is necessary for your custom cookie-based auth

**Therefore:** RLS policies would have NO EFFECT on your queries!

---

## Current Solution: Keep RLS Disabled + Frontend Filtering

### Pros:
- ‚úÖ Simple and straightforward
- ‚úÖ Already implemented and working
- ‚úÖ No complex RLS policy management
- ‚úÖ Frontend has full control

### Cons:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Relies on frontend code being correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If frontend has a bug, isolation could break
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct database access possible if someone bypasses frontend

---

## Better Solution: Backend API with Isolation

For **true security**, move product fetching to a backend API:

### Current (Frontend with Service Role):
```
Browser ‚Üí Supabase (Service Role) ‚Üí Database
         [No security layer]
```

### Recommended (Backend API):
```
Browser ‚Üí /api/products ‚Üí Supabase (Service Role) ‚Üí Database
         [Security layer checks franchise_id]
```

---

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Keep Current (Simplest) ‚úÖ CURRENT
- RLS: **DISABLED**
- Security: Frontend filtering
- When to use: Internal tools, trusted users, MVP

### Option 2: Add Backend API (Recommended)
- RLS: **DISABLED**
- Security: Backend API validates franchise_id
- When to use: Production, multiple franchises, external users

### Option 3: Use RLS (Complex, not recommended for your setup)
- RLS: **ENABLED with policies**
- Security: Database-level
- When to use: Using Supabase Auth (auth.uid()), not custom auth

---

## Current Recommendation: ‚úÖ Stay with Option 1

**Your current setup is FINE for now** because:

1. You already filter by `franchise_id` in code
2. You check `user.role !== "super_admin"` correctly
3. The same pattern is used in customers, staff, etc.
4. It's working and tested

**Later improvement:** Move to Option 2 (Backend API) for better security.

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ Test 1: Login as `mysafawale@gmail.com`
- Should see ONLY 10 products (Wedding Wear, Accessories, Party Wear)
- Should NOT see products from other franchises

‚úÖ Test 2: Login as `admin@safawala.com` (super admin)
- Should see ALL products from ALL franchises
- No franchise filter applied

‚úÖ Test 3: Try adding a product as franchise user
- Product should be assigned to their franchise_id automatically
- Should appear in their inventory list

‚úÖ Test 4: Try editing a product
- Should only be able to edit their own franchise's products
- (Check /app/inventory/edit/[id]/page.tsx for this logic)

---

## Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ Franchise isolation IS working via frontend filtering
**RLS:** Disabled (and should stay disabled for now)
**Security:** Good enough for internal CRM with trusted users
**Future:** Consider moving to backend API for production

**You're good to go!** üéâ
