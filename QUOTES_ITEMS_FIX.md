---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When viewing quote details in the Quotes page, the "Quote Items" section showed:
- Empty rows
- Quantity and prices visible
- **Product names missing**

Screenshot evidence shows:
- Item column: Empty
- Quantity: Shows "2"
- Unit Price: Shows "₹100.00"
- Total: Shows "₹200.00"

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Missing Product Names in Data Transform

**File:** `lib/services/quote-service.ts` (Lines 209-233)

**Problem:**
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Just passing raw items without extracting product name
quote_items: order.product_order_items,  // Missing product name!
```

The items had this structure:
```json
{
  "quantity": 2,
  "unit_price": 100,
  "total_price": 200,
  "product": {
    "name": "Wedding Sherwani"  // ← Name was here but not extracted
  }
}
```

But the UI expected:
```json
{
  "product_name": "Wedding Sherwani",  // ← This field was missing
  "quantity": 2,
  "unit_price": 100
}
```

---

### Issue 2: Wrong Table Reference

**File:** `lib/services/quote-service.ts` (Lines 105-113)

**Problem:**
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Wrong table name
product_order_items(
  *,
  product:products(name)  // ← Table "products" doesn't exist
)
```

The actual inventory table is called `inventory`, not `products`.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Extract Product Names from Nested Objects

**Product Orders (Lines 209-233):**
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Map items and extract product name
quote_items: (order.product_order_items || []).map((item: any) => ({
  ...item,
  product_name: item.product?.name || item.product_name || 'Product'
})),
```

**Package Bookings (Lines 235-259):**
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Map items and extract package name
quote_items: (booking.package_booking_items || []).map((item: any) => ({
  ...item,
  product_name: item.package?.name || item.package_name || 'Package'
})),
```

**Logic:**
1. Check if `item.product.name` exists (from join)
2. Fallback to `item.product_name` (if stored directly)
3. Final fallback to 'Product' or 'Package'

---

### Fix 2: Correct Table Reference

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Correct table name
product_order_items(
  *,
  product:inventory(name)  // ← Changed from "products" to "inventory"
)
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Before Fix:
```
Database → QuoteService.getAll() → Raw items without product_name
                                      ↓
                               Quotes Page → Empty cells ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Database → QuoteService.getAll() → Extract product_name from nested object
                                      ↓
                               Quotes Page → Shows product names ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test Steps:
1. ✅ Go to `/quotes` page
2. ✅ Click "View Details" on any quote
3. ✅ Check "Quote Items" section
4. ✅ Verify product names appear in Item column
5. ✅ Verify quantities and prices still show correctly

### Expected Results:
```
Item                    | Quantity | Unit Price | Total
------------------------|----------|------------|--------
Wedding Sherwani        |    2     |  ₹100.00   | ₹200.00
Designer Kurta Pajama   |    1     |  ₹150.00   | ₹150.00
```

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **lib/services/quote-service.ts**
   - Line 105-113: Changed `products` to `inventory` in join
   - Line 209-233: Added `.map()` to extract `product_name` from `product.name`
   - Line 235-259: Added `.map()` to extract `product_name` from `package.name`

---

## 🎯 Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ Quote items showed empty rows
- ❌ Confusing for users
- ❌ Cannot identify what products are in the quote
- ❌ PDF exports would also have empty product names

**After:**
- ✅ All product names display correctly
- ✅ Clear item breakdown in quotes
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ PDF exports will show product names

---

## 🔄 Related Systems

This fix also benefits:
- **Quote PDF Generation** - Product names will now appear in PDFs
- **Quote to Booking Conversion** - Item names preserved when converting
- **Reports & Analytics** - Accurate item tracking
- **Search Functionality** - Can search quotes by product name

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

### 1. Add More Item Details
Consider showing:
- Product code/SKU
- Category
- Product image thumbnail
- Rental duration (for rentals)

### 2. Standardize Table Names
Currently we have:
- `inventory` table (correct)
- Some code referencing `products` (incorrect)
- Should audit entire codebase and standardize to `inventory`

### 3. Add Variants
For package items, show:
- Package name: "51 Safas Premium"
- Variant: "Golden Collection"
- Extra safas: "5 extra"
