# 🎯 FRANCHISE-SPECIFIC DATA ISOLATION - COMPLETE FIX

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Each user now sees their own franchise data!

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem:**
1. ❌ **Settings showed SAME data for everyone** - Used hardcoded fallback franchise ID
2. ❌ **Header showed generic name** - Company settings not franchise-specific
3. ❌ **All users saw identical data** - No true session-based isolation
4. ❌ **localStorage was stale** - Not refreshed with current user data

### **Why This Happened:**
- Settings page had **hardcoded fallback**: `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
- Company Settings API was **global**, not franchise-filtered
- No `/api/auth/user` endpoint to get fresh user data
- Frontend relied on **localStorage** which could be outdated

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created `/api/auth/user` Endpoint**
**File:** `app/api/auth/user/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Get fresh, current user data from session cookie

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "franchise_admin",
  "franchise_id": "franchise-uuid",
  "franchise_name": "Mumbai Branch",
  "franchise_code": "MUM001",
  "franchise_city": "Mumbai",
  "isSuperAdmin": false
}
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Reads from `safawala_session` cookie
- ✅ Validates session is active
- ✅ Fetches fresh data from database
- ✅ Joins with franchises table for full info

---

### **2. Fixed Company Settings API to be Franchise-Specific**
**File:** `app/api/company-settings/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ Global query - same for everyone!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('company_settings')
  .select('*')
  .single()
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Franchise-specific query
const { franchiseId } = await getUserFromSession(request)

const { data } = await supabase
  .from('company_settings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('franchise_id', franchiseId)  // Filter by user's franchise!
  .single()
```

**Default Behavior:**
- If no settings exist for franchise, returns franchise name as company_name
- Each franchise can have different company settings
- Super admin sees their HQ settings, franchise admins see their own

---

### **3. Updated Dashboard Layout to Use Fresh API Data**
**File:** `components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ Used stale localStorage
const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()  // from localStorage
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Fetch fresh from API
const response = await fetch("/api/auth/user", {
  credentials: "include",
})
const userData = await response.json()
```

**Impact:**
- User data always fresh and current
- Shows correct franchise name in UI
- Reflects any role/permission changes immediately

---

### **4. Fixed Settings Page to Remove Hardcoded Fallback**
**File:** `app/settings/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ Hardcoded fallback - everyone saw same data!
if (!userData.franchise_id) {
  setFranchiseId('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001')
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ No fallback - require proper franchise
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/user', {
  credentials: 'include',
})

if (userData.franchise_id) {
  setFranchiseId(userData.franchise_id)  // Use user's actual franchise
} else {
  setError('No franchise associated with your account')
}
```

**Impact:**
- Settings are truly franchise-specific
- No more "default" data shown to everyone
- Clear error if user has no franchise

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Login Flow:**
```
1. User logs in with email/password
   ↓
2. API validates credentials
   ↓
3. Creates session cookie with user ID
   ↓
4. Returns full user object (with franchise info)
   ↓
5. Frontend stores in localStorage (for quick access)
```

### **Data Access Flow:**
```
1. User navigates to any page
   ↓
2. Page calls /api/auth/user (with session cookie)
   ↓
3. API reads session, fetches FRESH user data
   ↓
4. Returns user with current franchise info
   ↓
5. Page uses franchise_id to fetch data
   ↓
6. API filters data by user's franchise_id
   ↓
7. User sees ONLY their franchise data!
```

### **Settings Page Flow:**
```
1. Settings page loads
   ↓
2. Calls /api/auth/user to get franchise_id
   ↓
3. Passes franchise_id to ComprehensiveSettings component
   ↓
4. Component calls /api/company-settings
   ↓
5. API filters by franchise_id
   ↓
6. Returns THIS franchise's settings only!
```

## 📊 **What Each User Sees Now**

### **Super Admin (vardaan@gmail.com):**
- **Header:** "Safawala Headquarters" (or HQ001 franchise name)
- **Settings:** HQ franchise settings
- **Dashboard:** Global stats across ALL franchises
- **Data Pages:** Can see ALL franchises' data (because APIs check `isSuperAdmin`)
- **Franchise Name:** Shows in header/sidebar

### **Franchise Admin (e.g., mumbai@example.com):**
- **Header:** "Mumbai Branch" (their franchise name)
- **Settings:** ONLY Mumbai franchise settings
- **Dashboard:** ONLY Mumbai franchise stats
- **Data Pages:** ONLY Mumbai franchise data
- **Franchise Name:** Shows in header/sidebar

### **Different Franchise Admin (e.g., delhi@example.com):**
- **Header:** "Delhi Branch" (their franchise name)
- **Settings:** ONLY Delhi franchise settings
- **Dashboard:** ONLY Delhi franchise stats
- **Data Pages:** ONLY Delhi franchise data
- **Cannot see Mumbai data at all!**

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Login as Super Admin**
```
Email: vardaan@gmail.com
Password: Vardaan@5678

Expected Results:
✅ Header shows "Safawala Headquarters" or HQ name
✅ Settings show HQ franchise settings
✅ Can see all franchises in franchise list
✅ Dashboard shows global stats
✅ Customers/Bookings/Expenses show ALL data
```

### **Test 2: Login as Different Franchise Admin** (if available)
```
Email: [franchise-admin-email]
Password: [password]

Expected Results:
✅ Header shows THEIR franchise name
✅ Settings show THEIR franchise settings (different from HQ)
✅ Can only see THEIR franchise in lists
✅ Dashboard shows ONLY their franchise stats
✅ Customers/Bookings/Expenses show ONLY their data
```

### **Test 3: Compare Two Users Side-by-Side**
```
Browser 1: Login as Super Admin
Browser 2: Login as Franchise Admin

Compare:
❌ Should NOT show same data
✅ Each sees their own franchise name in header
✅ Each sees their own franchise settings
✅ Each sees their own dashboard stats
✅ Super admin sees more data than franchise admin
```

---

## 🔒 **Security Implementation**

### **Session-Based Authentication:**
```typescript
// Every API call:
1. Read safawala_session cookie
2. Extract user ID
3. Query database for fresh user data
4. Get franchise_id from user record
5. Filter data by franchise_id
```

### **Franchise Isolation:**
```typescript
// In every API:
const { franchiseId, isSuperAdmin } = await getUserFromSession(request)

if (!isSuperAdmin && franchiseId) {
  query = query.eq("franchise_id", franchiseId)  // Isolate!
}
```

### **No Hardcoded Fallbacks:**
- ❌ Removed all default franchise IDs
- ❌ Removed all hardcoded values
- ✅ Every query uses actual user's franchise
- ✅ Clear errors if franchise missing
