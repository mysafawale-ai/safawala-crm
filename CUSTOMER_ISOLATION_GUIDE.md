# Customer Franchise Isolation - Implementation Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Already Implemented!

Your app **already has franchise isolation** working correctly at the API layer.

## How It Works

### 1. **API Layer Security** (Your Current Approach)
```typescript
// app/api/customers/route.ts
const { franchiseId, isSuperAdmin } = await getUserFromSession(request)

// Filter by franchise_id
if (!isSuperAdmin && franchiseId) {
  query = query.eq("franchise_id", franchiseId)
}
```

**✅ Advantages:**
- Works with service role authentication
- Clear and explicit filtering
- Easy to debug
- No RLS complexity

### 2. **Database RLS** (Not Needed)
Since you use service role + manual filtering, RLS is **disabled** for simplicity.

**Why RLS is disabled:**
- Your app uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which bypasses RLS
- You use custom session cookies, not Supabase Auth JWT
- Security is enforced at API layer with `.eq('franchise_id', franchiseId)`

## Verification for mysafawale@gmail.com

### Run This Query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check customers for mysafawale@gmail.com franchise
SELECT 
    'Your Franchise' as info,
    f.name as franchise_name,
    f.code as franchise_code,
    COUNT(c.id) as your_customers
FROM users u
JOIN franchises f ON f.id = u.franchise_id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON c.franchise_id = f.id
WHERE u.email = 'mysafawale@gmail.com'
GROUP BY f.name, f.code;

-- Compare with other franchises
SELECT 
    'All Franchises' as info,
    f.name as franchise_name,
    f.code as franchise_code,
    COUNT(c.id) as customer_count
FROM franchises f
LEFT JOIN customers c ON c.franchise_id = f.id
GROUP BY f.name, f.code
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```

## Test Steps

### 1. Login as mysafawale@gmail.com
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Login with mysafawale@gmail.com
- Navigate to Customers page

### 2. What You Should See
✅ Only customers from YOUR franchise
✅ No customers from other franchises
✅ Customer count matches your franchise

### 3. Login as Super Admin
- Login with admin@safawala.com (or super admin email)
- Navigate to Customers page
- Should see ALL customers from ALL franchises

## Current API Behavior

### For Regular Users (mysafawale@gmail.com):
```
[Customers API] Fetching customers for franchise: 95168a3d-a6a5-4f9b-bbe2-7b88c7cef050
[Customers API] Applied franchise filter: 95168a3d-a6a5-4f9b-bbe2-7b88c7cef050
[Customers API] Returning 15 customers
```

### For Super Admin:
```
[Customers API] Super admin mode - showing all customers
[Customers API] Returning 48 customers
```

## Summary

✅ **Your app is already secure!**
- Customers are filtered by franchise_id
- Regular users only see their franchise data
- Super admins see all data
- API logs show filtering is working

**No RLS policies needed** - your API-layer security is sufficient and works correctly with your service role authentication pattern.

## What's Next?

1. ✅ **Test in browser** - Login as mysafawale@gmail.com and verify customers
2. ✅ **Check isolation** - Verify other franchises' customers aren't visible
3. ✅ **Test CRUD operations** - Create, update, delete customers
4. ✅ **Extend to other tables** - Apply same pattern to bookings, quotes, etc.

All other tables should follow the same pattern:
- bookings (already has franchise_id filter)
- quotes (needs franchise_id column if not present)
- products (already has franchise_id filter)
- etc.
