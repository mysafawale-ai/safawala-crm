## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Invoice Page Display Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Stats showed "2 invoices" but table was empty

### Root Cause
- Service query was selecting `products.code` column which **doesn't exist** in database
- This caused PostgreSQL error: `column products_2.code does not exist`
- Error handling returned empty array, hiding the real issue

### Solution Applied
**File:** `/lib/services/invoice-service.ts` (Line 26)
```typescript
// Before:
product:products(name, code)  // ‚ùå code doesn't exist

// After:
product:products(name)  // ‚úÖ Works!
```

### Result
‚úÖ Invoice page now displays 2 invoices correctly:
- ORD65777099
- ORD65880834

**See:** `INVOICE_FIX_RESOLUTION.md` for full debug details
