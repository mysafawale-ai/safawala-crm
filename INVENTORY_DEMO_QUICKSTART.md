## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Franchise not found for mysafawale@gmail.com"
**Solution:** User doesn't exist or has no franchise_id assigned
```sql
-- Check user's franchise
SELECT email, franchise_id FROM users WHERE email = 'mysafawale@gmail.com';

-- If franchise_id is NULL, assign one:
UPDATE users 
SET franchise_id = (SELECT id FROM franchises WHERE code = 'DHD' LIMIT 1)
WHERE email = 'mysafawale@gmail.com';
```

### Issue: "No products showing on inventory page"
**Solution:** Check if products were inserted
```sql
-- Verify products exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE is_active = true;

-- Check franchise assignment
SELECT p.name, f.name as franchise 
FROM products p 
LEFT JOIN franchises f ON p.franchise_id = f.id
LIMIT 5;
```

### Issue: "Can see all products (isolation not working)"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and re-login
```bash
# Or check if user role is correctly set
# User should NOT be 'super_admin' for isolation to work
```
