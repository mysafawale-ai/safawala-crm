### 🔗 Booking Integration

#### How It Works:
1. **Creating Delivery:**
   - Select customer
   - Optionally link to a booking
   - System auto-fills customer info from booking

2. **After Delivery Completed:**
   - Delivery appears in Returns tab
   - Shows return date from linked booking
   - Can reschedule return if needed

3. **Rescheduling Return:**
   - Updates `booking.return_date` via API

   - UI shows new return time immediately

4. **Return Date Logic:**
   ```typescript
   // Priority order:
   1. delivery.rescheduled_return_at (if rescheduled)
   2. booking.pickup_date (original return date)
   3. null (no return scheduled)
   ```

- "advance" → 30% payable now
- "partial" → 50% payable now, rest on delivery
// Plus security deposit handling
```

```
