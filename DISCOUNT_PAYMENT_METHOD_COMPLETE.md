## üìä TESTING RESULTS

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Discount Calculation
| Subtotal | Discount | After Discount | GST (5%) | Total |
|----------|----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| ‚Çπ10,000 | -‚Çπ0 | ‚Çπ10,000 | ‚Çπ500 | ‚Çπ10,500 |
| ‚Çπ10,000 | -‚Çπ1,000 | ‚Çπ9,000 | ‚Çπ450 | ‚Çπ9,450 |
| ‚Çπ5,000 | -‚Çπ500 | ‚Çπ4,500 | ‚Çπ225 | ‚Çπ4,725 |

**Result**: ‚úÖ All calculations correct

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Payment Method Validation
- Tested all 5 payment methods
- Database accepts valid values only
- Invalid values rejected by CHECK constraint
- Default value applies to existing records

**Result**: ‚úÖ All validations working

### ‚úÖ Test 3: UI Display
- Discount shows in Totals card (green text)
- Payment Method dropdown works
- Real-time updates on value change
- Forms save correctly to database

**Result**: ‚úÖ All UI components working
