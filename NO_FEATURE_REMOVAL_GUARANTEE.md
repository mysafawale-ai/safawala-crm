## 📝 Detailed Changes Per Component

### **API Routes (Backend):**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Still works, but shows all data)
export async function GET() {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from("customers")
    .select("*")
  return NextResponse.json({ data })
}

// AFTER (Enhanced with franchise filtering)
export async function GET() {
  const context = await getFranchiseContext()
  
  let query = supabase.from("customers").select("*")
  query = applyFranchiseFilter(query, context)
  // Super admin: No filter, sees all
  // Franchise admin: Filtered by their franchise
  
  const { data } = await query
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    data,
    franchise_context: {
      franchise_id: context.franchiseId,
      can_access_all: context.canAccessAllFranchises
    }
  })
}

// ✅ Same endpoint, same functionality
// ✅ Just adds franchise awareness
// ✅ No breaking changes
```

### **Frontend Pages:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Still works)
const CustomersPage = () => {
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/customers')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setCustomers(data))
  }, [])
  
  return <CustomerList customers={customers} />
}

// AFTER (Enhanced with franchise context)
const CustomersPage = () => {
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState([])
  const { franchise, isSuperAdmin } = useFranchise() // NEW
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/customers')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setCustomers(data)) // Auto-filtered by backend
  }, [franchise]) // Re-fetch when franchise changes
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* NEW: Show franchise context */}
      <FranchiseBadge franchise={franchise} />

## 🚀 Implementation Approach

### **Incremental & Safe:**
```
Step 1: Add franchise columns (non-breaking)
Step 2: Add middleware (doesn't affect existing code)
Step 3: Update ONE API route (test it)
Step 4: Update ONE page (test it)
Step 5: If working, continue with others
Step 6: If issue, roll back that one change

NO "big bang" deployment
NO "change everything at once"
YES gradual, tested migration
```

### **Testing at Each Step:**
```
After each change:
1. ✅ Test super admin access
2. ✅ Test franchise admin access
3. ✅ Test existing functionality still works
4. ✅ Test new franchise features work
5. ✅ Only proceed if all tests pass
```
