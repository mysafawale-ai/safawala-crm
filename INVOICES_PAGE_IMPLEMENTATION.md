# Invoices Page Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully created a clean, functional Invoices page to display and manage all confirmed bookings and orders (invoices). The page is similar to the Quotes page but shows records where `is_quote=false`.

## Implementation Date
December 2024

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Created InvoiceService (`lib/services/invoice-service.ts`)
A comprehensive service class to fetch and manage invoice data:

**Key Methods:**
- `getAll(filters)`: Fetches all invoices from `product_orders` and `package_bookings` where `is_quote=false`
- `getStats()`: Returns statistics including total, paid, partially_paid, overdue, total_revenue, pending_amount
- `getById(id, invoiceType)`: Fetches a single invoice by ID and type
- `updatePaymentStatus(id, invoiceType, paymentData)`: Updates payment information

**Data Transformation:**
- Combines data from both product orders and package bookings
- Calculates `payment_status` based on `amount_paid` vs `total_amount`:
  - `paid`: amount_paid >= total_amount
  - `partial`: 0 < amount_paid < total_amount  
  - `pending`: amount_paid = 0
- Maps fields to Invoice interface:
  - `invoice_number`: order_number or package_number
  - `invoice_type`: "product_order" or "package_booking"
  - `paid_amount`: amount_paid from database
  - `pending_amount`: pending_amount from database

### 2. ✅ Added Invoice Types (`lib/types.ts`)
Added complete TypeScript interfaces for invoices:

```typescript
export interface Invoice {
  id: string
  invoice_number: string
  invoice_type: "product_order" | "package_booking"
  customer_name?: string
  customer_phone?: string
  groom_name?: string
  bride_name?: string
  event_type?: string
  event_date?: string
  total_amount: number
  paid_amount?: number
  pending_amount?: number
  payment_status?: "pending" | "partial" | "paid"
  status: string
  created_at: string
  // ... plus 30+ other fields
}

export interface InvoiceItem {
  id: string
  invoice_id: string
  product_name: string
  quantity: number
  unit_price: number
  total_price: number
  // ... more fields
}

export interface CreateInvoiceData { ... }
export interface InvoiceFilters { ... }
```

### 3. ✅ Created Clean Invoices Page (`app/invoices/page.tsx`)
Built a simple, maintainable invoices page (460 lines) based on quotes page structure:

**Features:**
- **Responsive Layout**: Proper margins with `min-h-screen bg-gray-50 p-4 sm:p-6` and `max-w-7xl mx-auto` container
- **Stats Cards**: Display total, paid, partially_paid, overdue invoices plus total revenue
- **Search & Filters**: 
  - Search by invoice number, customer name, phone, groom/bride names
  - Filter by payment status (all/paid/partial/pending)
  - Filter by date range (all/today/week/month/quarter)
- **Invoice Table**: Shows all invoices with:
  - Invoice number
  - Customer name and phone
  - Event details (groom & bride names or booking type)
  - Creation date
  - Total amount, paid amount, balance (pending amount)
  - Payment status badge with color coding
  - Action buttons (View/Edit, Download PDF)
- **Empty State**: Shows helpful message when no invoices exist with link to quotes page
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**Old File Backup:**
- Backed up the corrupted 1397-line old file to `app/invoices/page_old_backup.tsx`
- New file is clean, maintainable, and follows best practices

### 4. ✅ Updated Sidebar (`components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`)
Added Invoices link under Quotes in the Business section:

```typescript
{
  title: "Invoices",
  url: "/invoices",
  icon: FileCheck,  // Added new icon import
  roles: ["super_admin", "franchise_admin", "staff"],
  description: "View and manage invoices for confirmed bookings and orders",
}
```

## How It Works

### Invoice Creation Flow
1. User creates a quote (product order or package booking with `is_quote=true`)
2. Quote appears in Quotes page
3. User clicks "Convert to Booking" on the quote
4. Quote is updated: `is_quote` changes from `true` to `false`, status changes to `pending_payment`
5. The same record now appears in Invoices page (because `is_quote=false`)

### Data Architecture
- **Quotes**: Records with `is_quote=true` in `product_orders` and `package_bookings`
- **Invoices**: Records with `is_quote=false` in `product_orders` and `package_bookings`
- **Quote Numbers**: Prefixed with `QT-`
- **Invoice Numbers**: Prefixed with `ORD-` (product orders) or `PKG-` (package bookings)

### Payment Status Logic
```javascript
payment_status = 
  amount_paid >= total_amount ? "paid" :
  amount_paid > 0 ? "partial" :
  "pending"
```

### Statistics Calculation
```javascript
{
  total: all invoices count,
  paid: invoices where amount_paid >= total_amount,
  partially_paid: invoices where 0 < amount_paid < total_amount,
  overdue: invoices with status "overdue",
  total_revenue: sum of all amount_paid,
  pending_amount: sum of all pending_amount
}
```

## Testing Results

**Test Script:** `test-invoices-page.js`

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Found 2 product order invoices
✓ Found 0 package booking invoices
✓ Search functionality working
✓ Payment status filters working
✓ Statistics calculated correctly

Invoice Statistics:
  Total Invoices: 2
  Paid: 0
  Partially Paid: 0
  Overdue: 0
  Total Revenue: ₹0
  Pending Amount: ₹210
```

**Verified Functionality:**
- [x] InvoiceService.getAll() fetches invoices correctly
- [x] InvoiceService.getStats() calculates stats correctly
- [x] Payment status calculated properly (paid/partial/pending)
- [x] Search works across multiple fields
- [x] Filters work for payment status and date ranges
- [x] Invoice numbers displayed correctly
- [x] Customer information displayed properly
- [x] Financial data (total, paid, pending) shown accurately
