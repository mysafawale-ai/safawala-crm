## Code Changes

### File: `/app/bookings/page.tsx`

#### Change 1: Updated Badge Click Handler
**Line 1030-1037**

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE
onClick={() => {
  setProductDialogBooking(booking)
  setProductDialogType('pending')
  setShowProductDialog(true)
}}

// ‚úÖ AFTER
onClick={() => {
  // Skip intermediate popup - go directly to product selection
  setCurrentBookingForItems(booking)
  setSelectedItems([])
  setShowItemsSelection(true)
}}
```

#### Change 2: Removed Entire "Selection Pending" Dialog
**Lines 1704-1777 (74 lines deleted)**

Removed the entire dialog that contained:
- Dialog wrapper
- DialogHeader with title
- Booking info cards
- "SELECT PRODUCTS NOW" button

This dialog is no longer needed since we go directly to product selection.
