## Usage

### For Staff Members
1. When creating a package booking or product order
2. In the final step (package) or sidebar (product order)
3. Select your name from the "Sales Closed By" dropdown
4. Complete the booking/order as usual

### For Admins/Managers
- Can run reports to see which staff closed which sales
- Use for calculating commissions/incentives
- Track performance metrics per staff member

### Sample Queries

**Get sales by staff member:**
```sql
-- Package bookings
SELECT 
  u.name as staff_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  SUM(pb.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM package_bookings pb
JOIN users u ON pb.sales_closed_by_id = u.id
WHERE pb.status = 'confirmed'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Product orders
SELECT 
  u.name as staff_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  SUM(po.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM product_orders po
JOIN users u ON po.sales_closed_by_id = u.id
WHERE po.status != 'quote'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Get sales for specific staff member:**
```sql
-- Replace 'Staff Name' with actual name
SELECT 
  pb.package_number,
  pb.customer_id,
  pb.total_amount,
  pb.created_at
FROM package_bookings pb
JOIN users u ON pb.sales_closed_by_id = u.id
