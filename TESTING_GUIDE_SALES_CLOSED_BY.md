# üß™ SALES CLOSED BY - COMPLETE TESTING GUIDE

## üéØ TESTING OBJECTIVE
Verify that `sales_closed_by_id` is working correctly across all forms and APIs.

---

## üìã PRE-TESTING CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Execute Database Migrations ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED FIRST

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run these migrations:

#### Migration 1: Add columns to product_orders & package_bookings
```sql
-- File: ADD_SALES_CLOSED_BY_COLUMN.sql
-- (Run this if not already executed)

ALTER TABLE product_orders 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sales_closed_by_id UUID REFERENCES users(id);

ALTER TABLE package_bookings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sales_closed_by_id UUID REFERENCES users(id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_product_orders_sales_closed_by 
ON product_orders(sales_closed_by_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_package_bookings_sales_closed_by 
ON package_bookings(sales_closed_by_id);
```

#### Migration 2: Add to quotes and create relationships
```sql
-- File: ADD_SALES_CLOSED_BY_TO_QUOTES.sql

ALTER TABLE quotes 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sales_closed_by_id UUID REFERENCES staff(id);

ALTER TABLE product_orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS from_quote_id UUID REFERENCES quotes(id);

ALTER TABLE package_bookings
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS from_quote_id UUID REFERENCES quotes(id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quotes_sales_closed_by ON quotes(sales_closed_by_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_product_orders_from_quote ON product_orders(from_quote_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_package_bookings_from_quote ON package_bookings(from_quote_id);
```

#### Verify Migrations
```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'product_orders' 
AND column_name IN ('sales_closed_by_id', 'from_quote_id');

SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'package_bookings' 
AND column_name IN ('sales_closed_by_id', 'from_quote_id');

SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'quotes' 
AND column_name = 'sales_closed_by_id';
```

**Expected Output**: Should show all columns exist with type `uuid` and nullable `YES`

---

## üß™ TEST SUITE 1: CREATE PRODUCT ORDER

### Test 1.1: Basic Order Creation WITHOUT Sales Staff
**Goal**: Verify field is optional

1. Navigate to: `https://mysafawala.com/create-product-order`
2. Fill in customer details
3. Add some products
4. Scroll down to **"Sales Closed By"** section
5. **Leave it as "None"** (don't select anyone)
6. Click **"CREATE ORDER"**

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Order created successfully
- Check database:
```sql
SELECT order_number, sales_closed_by_id 
FROM product_orders 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
- `sales_closed_by_id` should be `NULL`

---

### Test 1.2: Order Creation WITH Sales Staff Selected
**Goal**: Verify staff member is saved correctly

1. Navigate to: `https://mysafawala.com/create-product-order`
2. Fill in customer details

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Order created successfully
- Check database:
```sql
SELECT 
  po.order_number,

  u.email as staff_email
FROM product_orders po
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = po.sales_closed_by_id
ORDER BY po.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
- `sales_closed_by_id` should have a UUID
- `staff_name` and `staff_email` should show the selected staff member

---

### Test 1.3: Staff Dropdown Shows Correct People
**Goal**: Verify franchise isolation

1. Navigate to: `https://mysafawala.com/create-product-order`
2. Scroll to **"Sales Closed By"** section

- Shows staff role next to name (e.g., "Admin" or "Staff")
- Does NOT show staff from other franchises (if you're not super admin)

**Super Admin Test**:
- If you're super admin, should see staff from ALL franchises

---

### Test 1.4: Changing Staff Member
**Goal**: Verify you can change selection

1. Navigate to: `https://mysafawala.com/create-product-order`
2. Select **Staff Member A** from dropdown

  u.name as staff_name
FROM package_bookings pb
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = pb.sales_closed_by_id
ORDER BY pb.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
- Shows correct staff member

---

## üß™ TEST SUITE 3: BOOKINGS API

### Test 3.1: Fetch Bookings with Sales Staff
**Goal**: Verify API returns sales staff data

**Test via Browser Console**:
1. Open: `https://mysafawala.com/bookings`
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Refresh page
5. Find request to `/api/bookings`
6. Click on it and view **Response**

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "booking_number": "ORD12345",
      "customer": {...},
      "sales_closed_by_id": "uuid-of-staff",  // ‚Üê Should be present
      "quote": {
        "sales_closed_by_id": "uuid",
        "sales_staff": {
          "id": "uuid",
          "name": "Staff Name"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Test via API Direct Call**:
```bash
# In terminal
curl -X GET "https://mysafawala.com/api/bookings" \
  -H "Cookie: safawala_session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"
```

---

### Test 3.2: Verify Quote Relationship
**Goal**: Test from_quote_id linkage

1. Create a quote first
2. Convert quote to order
3. Check database:
```sql
SELECT 
  po.order_number,
  po.from_quote_id,
  q.quote_number,
  q.sales_closed_by_id as quote_sales_staff,
  po.sales_closed_by_id as order_sales_staff
FROM product_orders po
LEFT JOIN quotes q ON q.id = po.from_quote_id
WHERE po.from_quote_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY po.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- `from_quote_id` links to quote
- Both quote and order can have `sales_closed_by_id`

---

## üß™ TEST SUITE 4: EDGE CASES

### Test 4.1: Staff Member Deleted
**Goal**: Ensure system doesn't break if staff is deleted

1. Create order with Staff Member A
2. In database, delete or deactivate Staff Member A:
```sql
-- Don't actually delete, just test query
SELECT 
  po.order_number,
  po.sales_closed_by_id,
  u.name,
  u.is_active
FROM product_orders po
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = po.sales_closed_by_id
WHERE po.sales_closed_by_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Order still displays (doesn't crash)
- Shows NULL or "Deleted User" gracefully

---

### Test 4.2: Multiple Orders Same Staff
**Goal**: Test reporting capability

```sql
-- Count orders by sales staff
SELECT 
  u.name as staff_name,
  u.role,
  COUNT(po.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(po.total_amount) as total_sales
FROM product_orders po
JOIN users u ON u.id = po.sales_closed_by_id
WHERE po.sales_closed_by_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.role
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Shows sales report by staff member
- Useful for commissions/incentives

---

### Test 4.3: Franchise Isolation
**Goal**: Ensure franchise boundaries are respected

**As Franchise A User**:
```sql
-- Should only see your franchise's staff
SELECT 
  u.name,
  u.franchise_id,
  f.name as franchise_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN franchises f ON f.id = u.franchise_id
WHERE u.role IN ('staff', 'franchise_admin')
AND u.franchise_id = 'YOUR_FRANCHISE_ID';
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Only your franchise staff visible
- No cross-franchise data leak

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: "Column does not exist"
**Solution**: Run migrations first (see Step 1)

### Issue 2: Staff dropdown is empty
**Possible Causes**:
- No staff members in your franchise
- Franchise isolation issue
- User role not 'staff' or 'franchise_admin'

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, role, franchise_id, is_active
FROM users 
WHERE role IN ('staff', 'franchise_admin')
AND is_active = true;
```

### Issue 3: API doesn't return sales staff
**Solution**: Check if API enhancement was deployed
- Restart your Next.js server
- Clear browser cache
- Check API route file has latest changes

### Issue 4: Foreign key violation
**Error**: "violates foreign key constraint"
**Cause**: Staff member UUID doesn't exist in `users` table
**Solution**: Ensure selected staff exists and is active
