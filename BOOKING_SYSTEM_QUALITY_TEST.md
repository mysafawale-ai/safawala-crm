## 🔍 Steve Jobs Deep Dive - Product Bookings

### **Critical Questions:**

#### 1. **Inventory Integration** 🚨
```
Question: When creating product sale, does inventory actually decrease?

Test:
1. Check product stock before: 10 units
2. Create sale for 3 units
3. Check product stock after: Should be 7 units
4. If not → CRITICAL BUG

Current Status: ❓ NEEDS VERIFICATION
```

#### 2. **Rental vs Sale Pricing** 🚨
```
Question: Are we using correct price?

Sale: Should use product.price
Rental: Should use product.rental_price

Test:
1. Find product with price=1000, rental_price=100
2. Create sale → Total should use 1000
3. Create rental → Total should use 100
4. If using wrong price → CRITICAL BUG

Current Status: ❓ NEEDS VERIFICATION
```

#### 3. **Security Deposit** 🚨
```
Question: How is security deposit handled?

For Packages: Defined in package settings
For Products: Defined per product?

Test:
1. Create rental with security deposit
2. Check if deposit included in total_amount
3. Check if deposit tracked separately
4. Check refund process when returned

Current Status: ❓ NEEDS VERIFICATION
```

#### 4. **Return Date for Rentals** 🚨
```
Question: Is return date mandatory for rentals?

Required Fields:
- Pickup date ✅
- Return date ❓
- Duration calculation ❓

Test:
1. Try creating rental without return date
2. Should fail or warn
3. Check if duration calculated

Current Status: ❓ NEEDS VERIFICATION
```

#### 5. **Payment Tracking** 🚨
```
Question: Is amount_paid saved correctly?

Bug #2 Fixed: amount_paid now saves correctly
But verify:
1. Payment status calculated correctly
2. Partial payments tracked
3. Multiple payments possible?
4. Payment history visible?

Current Status: ✅ Bug fixed, needs testing
```

## 🎯 Recommendations for Product Bookings

### **Priority 1 - Critical (Must Have):**

}
```

#### **2. Rental Price Enforcement ⚠️**
```typescript
// In create-product-order:
const unitPrice = orderType === 'rental' 
  ? product.rental_price 
  : product.price

if (!unitPrice) {
  throw new Error(`${orderType} price not set for product`)
}
```

#### **3. Return Date Validation ⚠️**
```typescript
// For rentals:
if (orderType === 'rental' && !returnDate) {
  throw new Error('Return date required for rentals')
}

if (returnDate <= pickupDate) {
  throw new Error('Return date must be after pickup date')
}
```
