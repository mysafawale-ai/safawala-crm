# üéØ Inventory Franchise Isolation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete franchise isolation for the inventory management system. Each franchise now only sees and manages their own inventory products.

---

## üîê What Was Implemented

### 1. **Inventory List Page** (`/app/inventory/page.tsx`)

**Before**: ‚ùå All franchises saw ALL products
**After**: ‚úÖ Each franchise sees only their own products

#### Changes:
- Added User interface for type safety
- Created `fetchProductsForUser()` function to fetch current user from `/api/auth/user`
- Added franchise filtering: `query.eq("franchise_id", user.franchise_id)`
- Super admins can see all products (no filter applied)
- Regular users see only their franchise products

```tsx
const fetchProductsForUser = async () => {
  // Get current user from API
  const userRes = await fetch("/api/auth/user")
  const user: User = await userRes.json()
  
  let query = supabase
    .from("products")
    .select("*")
    .eq("is_active", true)
  
  // Only filter by franchise for non-super-admins
  if (user.role !== "super_admin" && user.franchise_id) {
    query = query.eq("franchise_id", user.franchise_id)
  }
  
  const { data, error } = await query
  setProducts(data || [])
}
```

### 2. **Add Product Page** (`/app/inventory/add/page.tsx`)

**Before**: ‚ùå Always used the first active franchise (wrong!)
**After**: ‚úÖ Uses logged-in user's franchise_id

#### Changes:
- Replaced hardcoded franchise lookup with user session check
- Fetch current user: `await fetch("/api/auth/user")`
- Use `user.franchise_id` for new products
- Proper error handling if franchise not found

```tsx
// OLD (Wrong):
const { data: franchise } = await supabase
  .from("franchises")
  .select("id")
  .eq("is_active", true)
  .limit(1)
  .single()

// NEW (Correct):
const userRes = await fetch("/api/auth/user")
const user = await userRes.json()
const productData = {
  ...
  franchise_id: user.franchise_id,
  ...
}
```

### 3. **Edit Product Page** (`/app/inventory/edit/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Before**: ‚ùå No franchise validation - users could edit any product
**After**: ‚úÖ Users can only edit products from their franchise

#### Changes:
- Added franchise validation in `fetchProduct()` function
- Fetch current user before querying product
- Apply franchise filter for non-super-admins
- Show error if product not found or user lacks permission

```tsx
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  // Get current user's franchise
  const userRes = await fetch("/api/auth/user")
  const user = await userRes.json()

  let query = supabase
    .from("products")
    .select("*")
    .eq("id", productId)
  
  // Only filter by franchise for non-super-admins
  if (user.role !== "super_admin" && user.franchise_id) {
    query = query.eq("franchise_id", user.franchise_id)
  }

  const { data, error } = await query.single()
}
```

## üìù Database Schema

### Products Table Franchise Column:
```sql
-- franchise_id is a foreign key to franchises.id
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD COLUMN franchise_id UUID REFERENCES franchises(id);

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_products_franchise_id 
ON products(franchise_id);
```

---

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check Franchise Isolation:
```sql
-- See product counts by franchise
SELECT 
    f.name as franchise_name,
    f.code as franchise_code,
    COUNT(p.id) as product_count,
    SUM(p.stock_total) as total_stock
FROM franchises f
LEFT JOIN products p ON f.id = p.franchise_id AND p.is_active = true
GROUP BY f.id, f.name, f.code
ORDER BY product_count DESC;
```

### Check mysafawale@gmail.com Products:
```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_code,
    p.name,
    p.brand,
    p.rental_price,
    p.stock_total,
    p.stock_available,
    f.name as franchise_name
FROM products p
JOIN users u ON p.franchise_id = u.franchise_id
JOIN franchises f ON p.franchise_id = f.id
WHERE u.email = 'mysafawale@gmail.com'
AND p.is_active = true
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```
