## 📝 Technical Notes

### Type Assertions Used
Due to optional fields not in base `Invoice` type, using `(selectedInvoice as any)` for:
- `delivery_time`, `return_time`
- `special_instructions`
- `distance_amount`, `distance_km`
- `coupon_code`, `coupon_discount`
- `gst_percentage`
- `payment_method`
- `invoice_items` array

### Data Flow
```
Database (23 new columns)
    ↓
Supabase Query
    ↓
Invoice Interface (TypeScript)
    ↓
Invoice Dialog (React Component)
    ↓
Rendered UI with full details
```

### Performance Considerations
- Items section uses `.map()` for dynamic rendering
- Variant inclusions use grid layout for clean display
- Conditional rendering for optional fields (no empty sections)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Critical Gap Identification**: The Items section was the most important missing piece - without it, customers couldn't see what they're paying for.

2. **Systematic Approach**: Breaking down the 35+ missing fields into 7 clear sections made the update manageable.

3. **Reference Template**: Using the Quotes dialog as a "gold standard" ensured consistency and completeness.

4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript helped catch errors, even when using type assertions for optional fields.

5. **Visual Design Matters**: Color coding, icons, and spacing make complex financial data scannable and professional.
