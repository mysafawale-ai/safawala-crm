## Troubleshooting

**Q: Edit button is disabled for someone**
A: Only if trying to edit yourself. Ask super admin for help.

**Q: I can't see staff from other franchises**
A: That's correct! You only manage your franchise's staff.

**Q: Can't change their role**
A: Only super admin can change roles. You can customize permissions instead.

**Q: They still can't access a feature after I enabled it**
A: Ask them to refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R) or logout/login.

**Q: What's the difference between Staff permission and Staff role?**
A: **Staff role** = their job level (Staff, Franchise Admin, etc.)
**Staff permission** = can they access this Staff page to manage others

## How to Know What to Give

**Ask yourself**: What features do they need to do their job?

- **Booking coordinator?** → Bookings, Customers, Invoices, Deliveries
- **Inventory manager?** → Inventory, Packages, Vendors, Product Archive
- **Accountant?** → Invoices, Expenses, Reports, Financials
- **Laundry staff?** → Laundry, Deliveries
- **Everyone needs?** → Dashboard, Settings

---

## What Your Staff Sees

After you enable a permission:

1. **Sidebar**: Menu item now visible ✅
2. **Click on it**: Feature works ✅
3. **If disabled**: Menu visible but 403 error

If they ask: "I don't have permission for X"
→ Check if you enabled it in Permissions tab
→ If not, enable it
→ They'll have access on page refresh

---

## Remember

- ✅ You manage your franchise's staff
- ✅ You can customize each person's permissions
- ✅ Changes take effect immediately (on refresh)
- ✅ All menu items visible to all users (you control access)
- ✅ You cannot edit yourself
- ❌ You cannot edit staff from other franchises
- ❌ You cannot change roles (ask super admin)
