## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/vendors` - Fetch vendors (via Supabase)
- `GET /api/laundry_batch_summary` - Fetch batches
- `GET /api/laundry_batch_items` - Fetch batch items
- `GET /api/products` - Fetch products
- `POST /api/laundry_batches` - Create batch
- `PUT /api/laundry_batches` - Update batch
- `POST /api/laundry_batch_items` - Add items

### Data Flow
```
1. Page Load
   ↓
2. Fetch vendors, batches, products from Supabase
   ↓
3. Display data in tables and cards
   ↓
4. User Actions (filter, create, edit, view)
   ↓
5. Update database
   ↓
6. Refresh data
   ↓
7. Show success toast
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  // Fetch data from Supabase
} catch (error) {
  // Show error toast
  // Set empty arrays (no mock data)
  // Display helpful empty state
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current State
- ✅ No mock data (uses real backend)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ All features functional
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### Limitations
1. Date filter only works on sent date (not return date)
2. Can't change vendor after batch creation
3. Notes can't be edited/deleted (only appended)
4. Item quantities can't be edited (must remove and re-add)

### Database Requirements
- Must have laundry management schema installed
- Vendors must exist in database
- Products table should have items

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Occur

1. **Check Console Errors**
   ```
   Press F12 → Console tab
   Look for red errors
   ```

2. **Verify Database**
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT * FROM vendors LIMIT 1;
   SELECT * FROM laundry_batches LIMIT 1;
   SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Check Network**
   ```
   F12 → Network tab
   Look for failed requests
   Check Supabase connection
   ```

4. **Rollback if Needed**
   ```bash
