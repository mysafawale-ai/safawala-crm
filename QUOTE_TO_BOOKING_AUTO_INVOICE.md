# Quote to Booking Conversion - Auto Invoice Creation

**Date**: 15 October 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED

---

## Summary

Updated the quote conversion flow to automatically create invoices and set bookings to "confirmed" status (skipping "pending_payment" since customer already agreed to pay).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Booking Status Changed

**Before**:
```typescript
status: "pending_payment"  // Had to manually confirm payment
```

**After**:
```typescript
status: "confirmed"  // Customer already agreed when accepting quote
```

**Reasoning**:
- Quote acceptance = Payment confirmation
- No need for extra "pending_payment" step
- Booking is ready to go directly to operations

---

### 2. Automatic Invoice Generation

**Location**: `app/api/quotes/convert/route.ts`

**New Flow**:
```
Quote Conversion
    â†“
1. Update quote status to "converted"
    â†“
2. Create NEW booking (status: "confirmed")
    â†“
3. Duplicate order items to new booking
    â†“
4. ðŸ†• AUTO-CREATE INVOICE
    â†“
5. Update inventory (reduce stock)
```

**Invoice Details**:
```typescript
Invoice Number: INV-{YEAR}-{TIMESTAMP}  // e.g., INV-2025-123456
Issue Date: Today
Due Date: Today + 15 days
Status: "unpaid" (or "paid" if already paid)
```

**What Gets Invoiced**:

**For Product Orders**:
- Fetches all product_order_items
- Creates individual invoice line items
- Each item shows: name, product code, quantity, price

**For Package Bookings**:
- Creates single line item
- Shows: Package number, event type, event date
- Total amount

---

### 3. Customer Information

Invoice automatically pulls customer data from:
1. Customer record (if customer_id exists)
2. Booking customer fields (fallback)
3. Quote customer fields (fallback)

Fields included:
- customer_name
- customer_email
- customer_phone
- customer_address

---

### 4. Invoice Calculations

```typescript
Subtotal: total_amount - tax_amount
Tax: tax_amount (from booking)
Discount: discount_amount (from booking)
Total: total_amount
Paid: amount_paid (from booking)
Balance: pending_amount (or total if not paid)
```

---

### 5. Error Handling

**Non-Critical Invoice Creation**:
```typescript
try {
  // Create invoice
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Invoice creation failed (non-critical)")
  // Continue with conversion
}
```

**Why Non-Critical**:
- Booking creation is the primary goal
- Invoice can be created manually if needed
- Don't block workflow for invoice errors

---
