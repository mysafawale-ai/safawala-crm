## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Date Filter**: Only filters by sent date (not return date)
2. **Batch Edit**: Can't change vendor after creation
3. **Notes**: No edit/delete for existing notes
4. **Items**: Can't edit item quantities in edit mode (only add/remove)

### Workarounds
1. Use search to find by vendor
2. Cancel and recreate batch if wrong vendor
3. Add correction note instead of editing
4. Remove and re-add item with correct quantity

### Future Fixes
These limitations could be addressed in future updates if needed.
