## üêõ If You Find Issues

### Issue: Items Section Not Showing
**Cause**: invoice_items data missing
**Fix**: Check Supabase query includes invoice_items

### Issue: Time Shows "Invalid"
**Cause**: delivery_time/return_time format issue
**Fix**: Verify time fields in database

### Issue: Type Error
**Cause**: Field not in Invoice type
**Fix**: Already using `(selectedInvoice as any)` - verify field name

### Issue: Colors Not Showing
**Cause**: Tailwind class typo
**Fix**: Check class names (text-green-600, bg-purple-50, etc.)

### Issue: Layout Broken on Mobile
**Cause**: Grid responsive issue
**Fix**: Verify md:grid-cols-2 breakpoint

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console for errors
3. Check Network tab for Supabase query
4. Verify data structure matches expected
