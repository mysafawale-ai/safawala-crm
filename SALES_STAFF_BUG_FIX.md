# Critical Bug Fix: Sales Staff Display - NOW WORKING ✅

## The Problem
Sales staff information was **NOT displaying** in the quotes UI, even though:
- ✅ Database columns existed (`sales_closed_by_id`)
- ✅ Data was populated (100% of quotes had values)
- ✅ UI component was coded
- ✅ Auto-select feature was working

## Root Cause Found 🔍

**File:** `lib/services/quote-service.ts` (Line 370)

**Bug:**
```typescript
// WRONG - querying non-existent 'staff' table
const { data: staffData, error: staffError } = await supabase
  .from('staff')  // ❌ This table doesn't exist!
  .select('id, name')
  .in('id', staffIds)
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// CORRECT - querying 'users' table
const { data: staffData, error: staffError } = await supabase
  .from('users')  // ✅ Correct table!
  .select('id, name')
  .in('id', staffIds)
```

### Why This Happened
- `sales_closed_by_id` is a foreign key to `users.id`
- The code was trying to query a `staff` table that doesn't exist
- This caused the staff fetch to fail silently
- Result: `sales_staff_name` was always `null`
- UI conditional rendering: `{selectedQuote.sales_staff_name && ...}` never showed

## The Fix
**Commit:** `a65ba80`
**File:** `lib/services/quote-service.ts`
**Change:** Line 370 - Changed `from('staff')` to `from('users')`
