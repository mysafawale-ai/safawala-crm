## How to Use

### Basic Usage
```typescript
// Import the function
import { downloadQuotePDF } from "@/lib/pdf/generate-quote-pdf"

// Download classic design
await downloadQuotePDF(quote, franchiseId, "classic")

// Download modern design
await downloadQuotePDF(quote, franchiseId, "modern")
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Add state to your component:**
```typescript
const [pdfDesign, setPdfDesign] = useState<PDFDesignType>("classic")
```

2. **Update your download function:**
```typescript
const handleDownloadPDF = async (quote: Quote) => {
  const franchiseId = user?.franchise_id
  await downloadQuotePDF(quote, franchiseId, pdfDesign)
  
  toast({
    title: "Success",
    description: `Quote PDF (${pdfDesign}) downloaded successfully`,
  })
}
```

3. **Add the design selector to your UI:**
```typescript
<Select value={pdfDesign} onValueChange={setPdfDesign}>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-[150px]">
    <SelectValue placeholder="PDF Design" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="classic">Classic PDF</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="modern">Modern PDF</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

## Where to Add the Selector

You can add the PDF design selector in multiple places:

1. **Page header** - Next to the "New Quote" button
2. **Quote details dialog** - In the action buttons area
3. **Table row dropdown** - As a submenu under "Download PDF"
4. **Bulk actions bar** - For downloading multiple quotes

See `/components/quotes/pdf-design-selector.tsx` for complete examples.

## Testing

To test the modern design:

1. **Navigate to Quotes page** (`/quotes`)
2. **Select a quote** to download
3. **Choose "Modern" from design selector**
4. **Click Download button**
5. **Check the generated PDF** for:
   - Card-based layout
   - Color coordination
   - Logo and branding
   - Clean typography
   - Proper spacing

## Design Comparison
