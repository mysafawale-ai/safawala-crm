-- =====================================================
-- QUICK AUTH & PERMISSIONS DIAGNOSTIC
-- =====================================================
-- Run this to verify your authentication and permissions
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Check current authenticated user (from Supabase Auth)
SELECT 
  'Current Auth User' as check_type,
  auth.uid() as user_id,
  auth.email() as email,
  CASE 
    WHEN auth.uid() IS NULL THEN '‚ùå NOT AUTHENTICATED'
    ELSE '‚úÖ Authenticated'
  END as auth_status;

-- 2. Check user profile and role
SELECT 
  'User Profile' as check_type,
  id,
  email,
  role,
  franchise_id,
  is_active,
  CASE 
    WHEN role IN ('franchise_admin', 'franchise_owner') THEN '‚úÖ Has packages permissions'
    WHEN role = 'super_admin' THEN '‚úÖ Full access'
    ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è Limited access'
  END as permission_level
FROM users
WHERE email = 'surat@safawala.com';

-- 3. Check if auth.uid() matches user in database
SELECT 
  'Auth Mapping' as check_type,
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) THEN '‚úÖ User found in database'
    ELSE '‚ùå User NOT found in database'
  END as mapping_status,
  auth.uid() as auth_user_id;

-- 4. Test packages_categories permissions
SELECT 
  'Packages Categories Access' as check_type,
  COUNT(*) as visible_categories,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ Can view categories'
    ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è No categories visible (might be empty table)'
  END as access_status
FROM packages_categories;

-- 5. Check RLS policies on packages_categories
SELECT 
  'RLS Policies' as check_type,
  policyname,
  cmd as operation,
  CASE 
    WHEN permissive = 'PERMISSIVE' THEN '‚úÖ Permissive'
    ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è Restrictive'
  END as policy_type
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'packages_categories'
ORDER BY cmd;

-- 6. Check if franchise_id column exists in packages_categories
SELECT 
  'Table Schema' as check_type,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'packages_categories'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 7. Final recommendation
SELECT 
  'üìã NEXT STEPS' as recommendation,
  CASE 
    WHEN auth.uid() IS NULL THEN 
      '1. You are NOT authenticated in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Log out from app completely
3. Clear browser storage (F12 > Application > Clear site data)
4. Log back in as surat@safawala.com
5. Re-run this diagnostic'
    WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) THEN
      '1. Auth session exists but user not in database
2. Check if user table has matching auth.uid()
3. May need to re-create user account'
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND role IN ('franchise_admin', 'franchise_owner', 'super_admin')
    ) THEN
      '‚úÖ Everything looks good! 
If category creation still fails:
1. Clear browser storage
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify session token is set with: localStorage.getItem("sb-xplnyaxkusvuajtmorss-auth-token")'
    ELSE
      '‚ö†Ô∏è User role is: ' || (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) || '
This role may not have packages permissions.
Consider updating role to franchise_admin.'
  END as action_required;
