## 1. Franchise Isolation

### API Implementation
**File:** `/Applications/safawala-crm/app/api/customers/route.ts`

#### ✅ GET /api/customers
- **Isolation:** Filters by franchise_id for non-super-admins
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  if (!isSuperAdmin && franchiseId) {
    query = query.eq("franchise_id", franchiseId)
  }
  ```
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Test:** Franchise users only see their own customers

#### ✅ POST /api/customers
- **Isolation:** Auto-assigns franchise_id from session
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  franchise_id: franchiseId,
  created_by: userId,
  ```
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Test:** New customers automatically assigned to user's franchise

#### ✅ PUT /api/customers/[id]
- **Isolation:** Verifies franchise ownership before update
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  existingQuery = existingQuery.eq("franchise_id", defaultFranchiseId)
  ```
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Test:** Can only update customers in own franchise

#### ✅ DELETE /api/customers/[id]
- **Isolation:** Verifies franchise ownership before delete
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  existingQuery = existingQuery.eq("franchise_id", defaultFranchiseId)
  ```
- **Checks:**
  - ✅ Related bookings check (prevents delete if bookings exist)
  - ✅ Franchise isolation enforced
- **Status:** WORKING

## 2. Auto WhatsApp Field - Edit Customer

### Issue
WhatsApp field was blank when editing customer even though data existed.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `/Applications/safawala-crm/app/customers/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Before:
whatsapp: data.whatsapp || "",

// After:
whatsapp: data.whatsapp || data.phone || "",  // Auto-fill from whatsapp or phone
```

### Test Cases
| Test Case | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Edit customer with whatsapp set | ❌ Blank | ✅ Shows whatsapp | FIXED |
| Edit customer without whatsapp | ❌ Blank | ✅ Shows phone | FIXED |
| Edit customer with neither | ✅ Blank | ✅ Blank | OK |

## 3. Delete Confirmation Dialogs

### A. Customer List Page
**File:** `/Applications/safawala-crm/app/customers/page.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. Added AlertDialog component import
2. Added state: `deleteDialogOpen`, `customerToDelete`
3. Replaced direct delete with confirmation flow:
   ```typescript
   handleDeleteClick(customer) → Opens dialog
   handleDeleteConfirm() → Performs actual delete
   ```

#### User Flow:

4. Success/error toast shown

#### Dialog Features:

### B. Customer Detail View
**File:** `/Applications/safawala-crm/app/customers/[id]/page.tsx`

2. Added state: `deleteDialogOpen`
3. Replaced browser confirm with AlertDialog:
   ```typescript
   // Before: if (!confirm("Are you sure..."))
   // After: Opens AlertDialog
   ```

#### Dialog Features:
- ✅ Shows customer name
- ✅ Warning about related data (bookings, payments)
- ✅ "Cannot be undone" message

```typescript
// Fixed implicit 'any' types:
(bookingsData || []).map((b: any) => b.id)
.reduce((sum: number, booking: any) => sum + (booking.amount_paid || 0), 0)

// Fixed missing properties with safe fallbacks:
payment.method?.replace("_", " ") || 'N/A'
payment.status || 'pending'
booking.type?.replace("_", " ") || 'N/A'
```
