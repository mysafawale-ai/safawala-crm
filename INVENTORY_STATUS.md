## üéØ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### Franchise Isolation Logic

**Before**: All users saw all products from all franchises ‚ùå

**After**: 
- Franchise admins see only their franchise's products ‚úÖ
- Super admins see all products from all franchises ‚úÖ

### Technical Implementation

```tsx
// In app/inventory/page.tsx
const fetchProductsForUser = async () => {
  // Get current user from API
  const userRes = await fetch("/api/auth/user")
  const user: User = await userRes.json()
  
  let query = supabase
    .from("products")
    .select("*")
    .eq("is_active", true)
  
  // Filter by franchise for non-super-admins
  if (user.role !== "super_admin" && user.franchise_id) {
    query = query.eq("franchise_id", user.franchise_id)
  }
  
  const { data, error } = await query
  setProducts(data || [])
}
```
