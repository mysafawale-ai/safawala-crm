## 🔧 WHAT I ADDED TODAY

Since everything was already working in the forms, I:

1. ✅ Added `sales_closed_by_id` to **quotes table**
2. ✅ Added `from_quote_id` to **product_orders** (links back to quote)
3. ✅ Added `from_quote_id` to **package_bookings** (links back to quote)
4. ✅ Enhanced **Bookings API** to fetch sales staff data
5. ✅ Created migration file: `ADD_SALES_CLOSED_BY_TO_QUOTES.sql`
6. ✅ Updated permanent schema: `scripts/quotes-schema.sql`
7. ✅ Created comprehensive audit: `SALES_CLOSED_BY_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md`

## 📝 TO DO

### Execute Migration (One Time)
Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

**File 1**: `ADD_SALES_CLOSED_BY_COLUMN.sql` (if not already run)
```sql
-- Adds sales_closed_by_id to product_orders & package_bookings
```

**File 2**: `ADD_SALES_CLOSED_BY_TO_QUOTES.sql` (new)
```sql
-- Adds sales_closed_by_id to quotes
-- Adds from_quote_id relationships
```

### That's It!
After migration, you have:
- ✅ Sales tracking in product orders
- ✅ Sales tracking in package bookings
- ✅ Sales tracking in quotes
- ✅ Full relationship between quotes and bookings
- ✅ API that fetches everything
