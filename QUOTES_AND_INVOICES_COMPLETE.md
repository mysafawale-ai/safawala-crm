## Part 1: Quotes Page Improvements âœ…

### Issues Fixed
1. âœ… **Layout Issues**: Content was going out of screen
   - Added proper margins: `min-h-screen bg-gray-50 p-4 sm:p-6`
   - Added max-width container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto`
   - Made fully responsive for all screen sizes

2. âœ… **Quote Fetching**: Quotes weren't showing up
   - Updated `QuoteService.getAll()` to query from `product_orders` and `package_bookings`
   - Filter by `is_quote=true` to show only quotes
   - Tested and verified: 5 quotes found (4 product + 1 package)

3. âœ… **Edit Button**: No way to edit quotes
   - Added Edit button in actions column
   - Routes to `/create-product-order?edit={id}` for product orders
   - Routes to `/book-package?edit={id}` for package bookings

4. âœ… **Convert Functionality**: Wrong implementation creating duplicate data
   - Completely rewrote `/api/quotes/convert` endpoint
   - Now updates existing record instead of creating new one
   - Sets `is_quote=false` and `status=pending_payment`
   - Reduces inventory for product orders
   - Simplified `ConvertQuoteDialog` to pass only essential data

### Files Modified (Quotes)
- `/app/quotes/page.tsx` - Layout fixes and Edit button
- `/lib/services/quote-service.ts` - Updated queries
- `/app/api/quotes/convert/route.ts` - Complete rewrite (150â†’95 lines)
- `/components/quotes/convert-quote-dialog.tsx` - Simplified logic

### Documentation
- `QUOTES_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete documentation
- `test-quotes-page.js` - Test script that verified 5 quotes

## Part 2: Invoices Page Creation âœ…

### What Was Built
Created a complete Invoices management page from scratch to show confirmed bookings and orders.

### Key Components

#### 1. InvoiceService (`lib/services/invoice-service.ts`)
**308 lines** - Complete service layer for invoices

**Methods:**
- `getAll(filters)` - Fetches invoices from both tables where `is_quote=false`
- `getStats()` - Returns total, paid, partial, overdue, revenue, pending
- `getById(id, type)` - Fetches single invoice
- `updatePaymentStatus()` - Updates payment info

**Logic:**
```javascript
// Payment status calculation
payment_status = 
  amount_paid >= total_amount ? "paid" :
  amount_paid > 0 ? "partial" :
  "pending"

// Fetches from both:
- product_orders where is_quote=false
- package_bookings where is_quote=false
```

#### 2. Invoice Types (`lib/types.ts`)
Added 4 new interfaces:
- `Invoice` (60+ fields)
- `InvoiceItem`
- `CreateInvoiceData`
- `InvoiceFilters`

Lines 483-589 in types.ts

#### 3. Invoices Page (`app/invoices/page.tsx`)
**460 lines** - Clean, maintainable implementation

**Features:**
- Responsive layout with proper margins
- 5 stats cards: Total, Paid, Partial, Overdue, Revenue
- Search: by invoice number, customer name, phone, groom/bride names
- Filters: Payment status (all/paid/partial/pending) and date ranges
- Table view with all invoice details
- View/Edit and Download buttons per invoice
- Empty state with helpful message
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

**Old File:**
- Backed up corrupted 1397-line file to `page_old_backup.tsx`

#### 4. Sidebar Integration (`components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`)
Added Invoices menu item:
- Placed under Quotes in Business section
- Uses FileCheck icon
- Description: "View and manage invoices for confirmed bookings and orders"

### Testing Results
**Test Script:** `test-invoices-page.js`

**Results:**
```
âœ“ Found 2 product order invoices
âœ“ Found 0 package booking invoices
âœ“ Statistics: 2 total, 0 paid, 0 partial, â‚¹210 pending

```

## How Quote-to-Invoice Flow Works

### The Complete Journey

1. **Create Quote**
   - User creates product order or package booking
   - System sets `is_quote=true`
   - Quote number: `QT-12345678`
   - Appears in Quotes page

2. **Quote in Quotes Page**
   - Shows in quotes table
   - Has "Convert to Booking" button
   - Can be edited, sent, accepted, rejected

3. **Convert Quote**
   - User clicks "Convert to Booking"
   - API updates same record:
     - `is_quote` â†’ `false`
     - `status` â†’ `pending_payment`
   - For product orders: Reduces inventory
   - Returns booking details

4. **Invoice in Invoices Page**
   - Same record now appears in Invoices
   - Invoice number: `ORD-12345678` or `PKG-12345678`
   - Shows payment status (pending/partial/paid)
   - Can be viewed/edited

### Data Architecture

**Database Tables:**
- `product_orders` - Product rental orders
- `package_bookings` - Complete package bookings

**Quote vs Invoice:**
- Quote: `is_quote = true`
- Invoice: `is_quote = false`

**Services:**
- `QuoteService.getAll()` - WHERE is_quote=true
- `InvoiceService.getAll()` - WHERE is_quote=false

## Statistics Comparison
