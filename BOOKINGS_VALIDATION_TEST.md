## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Product images not showing
**Cause**: API not returning image_url or broken URLs
**Fix**: Check database - products table should have image_url column populated

### Issue: "Selection Pending" shows for bookings WITH items
**Cause**: has_items flag not set correctly
**Fix**: Check /api/bookings route - should set has_items based on item counts

### Issue: Items API returns 500 error
**Cause**: Table structure mismatch or missing foreign keys
**Fix**: Verify product_order_items and package_booking_items tables exist

### Issue: Filter doesn't work
**Cause**: matchesProducts logic not included in filter
**Fix**: Verify return statement includes: `&& matchesProducts`

### Issue: Duplicate badges in actions
**Cause**: Old badge code not removed
**Fix**: Remove the conditional badge showing "Product: Selected/Pending"
