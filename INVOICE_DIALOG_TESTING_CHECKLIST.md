## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues
1. **invoice_items data structure**: May vary between package_bookings and product_orders
2. **variant_inclusions**: Check if data comes as JSON array
3. **Time formatting**: Ensure delivery_time/return_time display correctly
4. **Type assertions**: Using `(selectedInvoice as any)` - verify no runtime errors

### If Issues Found
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify data structure in Network tab (Supabase query)
3. Check if optional fields are null vs undefined
4. Verify type assertions don't cause crashes
